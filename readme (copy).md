# ðŸŒŠ ProxySea

**ProxySea** is an asynchronous Python framework for fetching, testing, and managing public HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxies. It supports integration with libraries like `requests`, `httpx`, and more, allows testing of custom proxy lists, and is designed with modularity and future extensibility in mind (for example, adding an API layer).

Whether you're scraping proxy data from public sources, testing network behavior, or sending requests via third-party proxies â€” **you use this software at your own risk**. Any misuse, abuse, or illegal activity carried out using ProxySea is solely the responsibility of the user.

Please respect target servers and third-party services. ProxySea was created to provide technical insight and support ethical use only.


## Features

- Fetches public proxies from multiple online providers.
- Fully asynchronous fetching and testing of proxies.
- Automatically detects each proxyâ€™s protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5).
- Enables very fast testing of your own proxy list.
- Built-in logging system with optional debug mode.
- Includes unit tests (partial coverage).

        # - Is the proxy alive
        # - Is the proxy blacklisted (if retries > 3)
        # - Number of connection retries
        # - Proxy anonymity level
